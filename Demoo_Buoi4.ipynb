      "\n",
      "\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been\n",
      "imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of\n",
      "these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the\n",

      "On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \"There is\n",
      "absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is\n",
      "imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of\n",
      "security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases\n",
      "the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances\n",
      "under which a trial will not be held in public.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on\n",
      "the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person\n",
      "sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of\n",
      "Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to\n",
      "know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public\n",
      "sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of\n",

      "The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai\n",

      "cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned,\n",
      "and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation\n",

      "suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am\n",
      "speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee\n",
      "was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole\n",

      "\n",

      "happy...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the\n",
      "laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a\n",
      "person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible. \n",
      "\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's\n",
      "that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long\n",
      "years in prison without us knowing anything about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "-- Do you find this situation acceptable?\n",
      "\n",
      "Attorney Arnon: \"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and\n",
      "such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that\n",
      "publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but\n",
      "total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of\n",
      "Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged\n",
      "with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The\n",
      "trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for\n",
      "those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand,\n",
      "though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least\n",
      "are aware of his imprisonment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "-- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the\n",
      "discretion of the court?\n",
      "\n",
      "Attorney Arnon: \"The judges have no choice but to trust the\n",
      "presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to\n",
      "investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which\n",
      "they can misuse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "-- And what if there really is a security issue?\n",
      "\n",
      "Attorney Arnon: \"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.\n",
      " Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible\n",
      "to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without\n",
      "entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning\n",
      "publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller\n",
      "murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the\n",
      "matter being made public.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can\n",
      "be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's\n",
      "arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \"A healthy\n",
      "situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere\n",
      "publication may be harmful to state security\".\n",
      "\n",
      "A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former\n",
      "advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda\n",
      "Meir.  \"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such\n",
      "situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must\n",
      "be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom\n",
      "of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom\n",
      "which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nevertheless\", adds Shtendal, \"the legislator allowed for the\n",
      "possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the\n",
      "damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that\n",
      "which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned.\n",
      "The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with\n",
      "the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which\n",
      "we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has\n",

      "percent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI \n",
      "around 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in \n",

      "disease starts with a given society's elite, who typically eat a different \n",
      "diet than the average citizen.  \"If the pattern of afluence increases, the \n",
      "entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, \n",
      "which places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the \n",

      "software developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical\n",
      "Proton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses\n",

      "   In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS\n",

      "believed to be associated with the progression of the disease.\n",
      "   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely\n",

      "interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to\n",
      "the nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15\n",

      "\n",
      "   What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused?\n",
      "   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of\n",
      "the brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist\n",
      "Alois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of\n",
      "memory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality,\n",
      "loss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.\n",
      "   How many people does it affect?\n",
      "   Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in\n",
      "the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking\n",
      "approximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer's\n",
      "debilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both\n",
      "emotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is the\n",
      "most common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every\n",
      "year, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.\n",
      "   What are its signs and symptoms?\n",
      "   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have\n",
      "been identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk\n",
      "of developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50\n",
      "yars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life\n",
      "to reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial\n",
      "AD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of\n",
      "developing AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe \"forgetfulness\"\n",
      "caused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School\n",
      "of Medicine at New York University says \"whether forgetfulness is\n",

      "   -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.\n",

      " \n",
      " Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for\n",
      " nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with\n",
      " San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many\n",

      " \"Skins\" and \"Pinkos,\" but that did not necessarily mean that they were\n",
      " under surveillance.\n",
      " \n",
      " \"I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,\" Bullock said.\n",

      " The file notes that Kraft's articles \"appear frequently in The Times\n",

      "broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local\n",
      "receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using\n",
      "the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very\n",

      "\thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring\n",
      "\tfor the following things:\n",
      "\n",
      "\t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to\n",
      "\t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will\n",
      "\t       be stamped with \"Al/Cu\" or \"CO/ALR\".  The latter supersedes\n",

      "\n",
      "\t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around\n",
      "\t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be\n",
      "\t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the\n",

      "\t    \n",

      "\n",
      "        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists\n",
      "    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes' \n",
      "    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the \n",
      "    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest \n",
      "    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American \n",
      "    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell \n",
      "    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern \"continent\" of Ishtar Terra.  \n",

      "    called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan \n",
      "    (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even \n",
      "    finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet \n",
      "    probes maintained that distinction.\n",
      "\n",

      "    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few\n",
      "    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating \n",
      "    current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds \n",
      "    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) \n",
      "    lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty \n",

      "\t\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is\n",
      "\tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower\n",
      "\tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\n",
      "\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\n",

      "    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try\n",

      "    1)\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\n",
      "\n",
      "    2)\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\n",
      "\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\n",
      "\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\n",
      "\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\n",
      "\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\tThis causes a little bit of\n",

      "\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the\n",
      "\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "    3)\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\n",
      "\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\n",
      "\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\n",
      "\tthe case if we didn't roll (\"performance gain\").\n",

      "\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\n",
      "\n",
      "    6)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\n",
      "\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "    7)\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\n",
      "\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\n",
      "\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\n",
      "\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\n",
      "\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\n",
      "\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\n",
      "\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\n",
      "\n",
      "    This all begs the question, \"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give\n",
      "    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\n",
      "    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\n",
      "    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\n",
      "    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\n",
      "    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\n",
      "    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\n",
      "    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\n",
      "    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\n",
      "    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\n",
      "    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the\n",
      "    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle\n",
      "    guy.)\n",
      "\n",
      "    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\tHe added that the \"roll\n",
      "    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\n",
      "    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\n",
      "    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\n",
      "    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\n",
      "    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\n",
      "    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\n",

      "\n",
      "    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\n",
      "    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\n",
      "    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\n",
      "    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\n",
      "    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\n",
      "    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\n",
      "    for these viewers.\n",
      "\n",
      "    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\n",
      "    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\n",
      "    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\n",
      "    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\n",
      "    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\n",

      "\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\n",
      "options list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\n",
      "that O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\n",
      "been dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\n",
      "in launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\n",
      "an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, there are three options being considered, as presented\n",
      "to the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\n",
      "today's Times).\n",
      "\n",
      "Option \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\n",
      "This option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\n",
      "there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\n",
      "the SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\n",
      "Reston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\n",
      "teams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\n",
      "option are:\n",
      "  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's\n",
      "     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\n",
      "     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\n",
      "     for the Air Force.\n",
      "  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\n",
      "     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\n",
      "     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\n",
      "     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\n",
      "     source for 30 day missions.\n",
      "  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\n",
      "     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\n",
      "     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\n",
      "     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\n",
      "     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\n",
      "     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\n",
      "     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\n",
      "  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\n",
      "     add another 20 kW of power\n",
      "  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\n",
      "     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\n",
      "     Vehicle).\n",
      "\n",
      "Option \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\n",
      "The Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\n",
      "This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\n",
      "have all come to know and love :)\n",
      "\n",
      "This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\n",
      "use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \n",
      "number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\n",
      "for both options \"A\" and \"B\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The build-up occurs in six phases:\n",
      "  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\n",
      "     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\n",
      "     it visits.\n",
      "  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\n",
      "     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\n",
      "     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\n",
      "  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\n",
      "     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\n",
      "     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\n",
      "     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\n",
      "  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\n",
      "     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\n",
      "     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\n",
      "  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\n",
      "     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\n",
      "     assembly in 24 flights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \n",
      "with the exception of the data management system, which has major\n",
      "changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option C - Single Core Launch Station.\n",
      "This is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\n",
      "cylinder that's 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\n",
      "the backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \n",
      "regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\n",
      "motors, and launch the can. Some key features are:\n",
      "  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\n",
      "  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\n",
      "  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\n",
      "    micrometeroid & orbital debris)\n",
      "  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\n",
      "  - 7 berthing ports\n",
      "  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\n",
      "    (twice the volume of skylab).\n",
      "  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\n",
      "  - 10 kW of housekeeping power\n",
      "  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\n",
      "    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)\n",
      "  - increased crew time for utilization\n",
      "  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\n",

      "  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image\n",
      "  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil\n",
      "  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\n",
      "  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\n",
      "  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\n",
      "  as a huge user-contributed library.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Feature description\n",
      "\n",
      "  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\n",
      "  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\n",
      "  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\n",
      "  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\n",
      "  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\n",
      "  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\n",
      "  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\n",
      "  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\n",
      "  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\n",
      "  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\n",
      "  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\n",
      "  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\n",
      "\n",
      "  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\n",
      "  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\n",
      "  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\n",
      "  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\n",
      "  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\n",
      "  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\n",
      "  pages, and on-line documentation.\n",

      "\n",
      "  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\n",
      "  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\n",
      "  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\n",
      "  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\n",
      "  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\n",
      "  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\n",
      "  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\n",
      "  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\n",
      "  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\n",
      "  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\n",

      "  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\n",

      "--------------------------------\n",
      "  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\n",
      "  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\n",
      "  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\n",
      "  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\n",
      "  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\n",
      "  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\n",
      "  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\n",
      "  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\n",
      "  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\n",
      "  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\n",
      "  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X\n",

      "[1]  What is JPEG?\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized image compression mechanism.\n",
      "JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the\n",
      "committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either\n",
      "full-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\n",
      "It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\n",
      "drawings.\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\n",
      "handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\n",
      "of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\n",
      "respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\n",
      "quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\n",
      "of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\n",
      "the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\n",
      "of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\n",
      "be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\n",
      "small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\n",
      "invisible to the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\n",
      "adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\n",
      "off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\n",
      "files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\n",
      "archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\n",
      "aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\n",
      "can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[2]  Why use JPEG?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n",
      "24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\n",
      "networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n",
      "2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\n",
      "disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\n",
      "size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n",
      "\n",
      "If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\n",

      "I suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has\n",
      "a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,\n",
      "instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot\n",
      "that spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers\n",

      "knot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color\n",
      "of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that\n",
      "observers will say: \"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a\n",
      "piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its\n",
      "presence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a\n",
      "great work of art.\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was\n",
      "looking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not\n",
      "contained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,\n",
      "but a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God\n",
      "would still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,\n",
      "but He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not\n",
      "betrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected\n",
      "Jesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if\n",
      "Pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set\n",
      "Jesus free, it might appear that there would have been no\n",
      "Crucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no\n",
      "Salvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If\n",
      "Judas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled\n",
      "the world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know\n",
      "how Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its\n",
      "interior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and\n",
      "just as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth\n",
      "game agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops\n",
      "and had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up\n",
      "the game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is\n",
      "none the less valid).\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of\n",
      "Pilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice\n",
      "was not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's\n",
      "plans by behaving justly and courageously.\n",
      "\n",
      "What, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \"I\n",

      "Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet\n",
      "with God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty\n",

      "     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\n",
      "suggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\n",
      "\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\n",
      "terminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\n",
      "juxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\n",
      "the Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\n",
      "not originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\n",
      "acquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\n",
      "\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\n",
      "observes, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\n",
      "of pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\n",
      "native-speaking Greeks (108).\n",
      "\n",
      "     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\n",
      "object of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's \"learned discussion\"\n",
      "(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\n",
      "male\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\n",
      "which Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\n",
      "active partner \"who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on\n",
      "occasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\n",
      "refer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\n",
      "model of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\n",
      "affirms (109).\n",
      "     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\n",
      "combination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\n",
      "dealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\n",
      "dealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\n",
      "pederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\n",
      "purposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\n",
      "minded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\n",
      "instances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\n",
      "general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \n",
      "Consequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\n",

      "vices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\n",
      "function of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\n",
      "relationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\n",
      "nonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\n",

      "     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\n",

      "\n",
      "     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\n",
      "come under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's\n",
      "view is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\n",
      "several shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\n",
      "Boswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\n",
      "18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\n",
      "Constitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \n",
      "Boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\n",
      "derives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\n",
      "is significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's\n",
      "claim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\n",
      "gender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\n",
      "a male,\" making arseno- the object.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the\n",
      "term, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\n",
      "compounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\n",
      "as an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\n",
      "one of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\n",
      "between the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\n",
      "the second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\n",
      "object and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\n",
      "gender\" (132). \n",
      "\n",
      "     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\n",
      "takes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \n",
      "For example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\n",
      "androbaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\n",
      "homosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\n",
      "Hippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\n",
      "Syriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\n",
      "the Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \n",
      "\n",
      "     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\n",
      "parallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\n",
      "dominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\n",
      "parallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\n",
      "(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\n",
      "(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\n",
      "Ten Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\n",
      "adultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\n",
      "boys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\n",
      "\n",
      "     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\n",
      "Sibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\n",
      "coined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\n",
      "Or.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\n",
      "\n",
      "     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\n",
      "upon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\n",
      "the Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\n",
      "homosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be\n",
      "absent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\n",
      "(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\n",
      "the first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\n",
      "dozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\n",
      "Didache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing\n",
      "Scripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \n",
      "\n",
      "     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention\n",
      "(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\n",
      "omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\n",
      "long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\n",
      "1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright\n",
      "observes that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\n",
      "arsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\n",
      "activity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\n",
      "and the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\n",
      "specified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \n",
      "\n",
      "     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\n",
      "and I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\n",
      "\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\n",
      "the word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited\n",
      "conclusion based on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\n",
      "catalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\n",
      "in late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\n",
      "homosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\n",
      "part of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\n",
      "being under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\n",
      "male activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\n",
      "engagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\n",
      "interchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\n",
      "\n",
      "     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\n",
      "homosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\n",
      "others who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\n",

      "PURPOSE OF THE GROUP: \n",
      "====================\n",
      "\n",
      "The Taize Community is an international ecumenical community of monks \n",
      "based in France. Many young adults come there to search for meaning in \n",
      "their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a \n",
      "sharing with others. This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a \n",
      "monthly \"Johannine Hour\" which will be posted at the beginning of each \n",
      "month. A \"Johannine hour\" involves a short commentary on a given Bible \n",
      "passage, followed by some questions for reflection.  Any thoughts that \n",
      "may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be \n",
      "posted here. We are not interested in theological debate, and even less \n",
      "in polemics. No expertise is required! The idea is to help one another \n",
      "to deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own \n",
      "life-journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of \"Johannine hours\" was born in Taize as a simple response\n",
      "to all those who were trying to assimilate the Bible's message in the\n",
      "midst of their daily life. Because of work or studies, it is often\n",
      "impossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, but\n",
      "everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sit\n",
      "quietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. There, in silence,\n",
      "we can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice of\n",
      "Christ.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we \n",
      "understand and not waste time worrying if, in some Biblical expressions, \n",
      "we find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ. The idea is to \n",
      "communicate to others what we have understood of Christ, not burdening \n",
      "them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought \n",
      "us joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps those who read and think about the \"Johannine Hours\" in this\n",
      "newsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, the\n",
      "personal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspect\n",
      "of sharing, which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network.\n",
      "\n",
      "BACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY:\n",
      "=================================\n",
      "\n",
      "The following provides some background information on the life and\n",
      "vocation of the Taize (pronounced te-zay) community.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A PARABLE OF COMMUNION\": August 1940, with Europe in the grip of\n",
      "World War II, Brother Roger, aged 25, set up home in the almost\n",
      "abandoned village of Taize, in Eastern France. His dream: to bring\n",
      "together a monastic community which would live out \"a parable of\n",
      "community\", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of\n",
      "the time. Centering his life on prayer, he used his house to conceal\n",
      "refugees, especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation.\n",
      "\n",
      "AN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY: Taize's founder spent the\n",
      "first two years alone. Others joined him later and at Easter 1949,\n",
      "seven brothers committed themselves together to common life and\n",
      "celibacy. Year by year, still others have entered the community, each\n",
      "one making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation.\n",
      "Today, there are 90 brothers, Catholics and from various Protestant\n",
      "backgrounds, from over twenty different countries. Some of them are\n",
      "living in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia, Africa, North\n",
      "and South America. The brothers accept no donations or gifts for\n",
      "themselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds no\n",
      "capital. The brothers earn their living and share with others\n",
      "entirely through their own work. In 1966, Sisters of Saint Andrew, an\n",
      "international Catholic community founded 750 years ago, came to live\n",
      "in the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcoming\n",
      "people in Taize.\n",
      "\n",
      "TAIZE AND THE YOUNG; THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS: Young adults, and\n",
      "less young, have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since\n",
      "1957. Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond have\n",
      "thus been brought together in a common search. Intercontinental\n",
      "meetings take place each week, Sunday to Sunday, throughout the year\n",
      "and they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any\n",
      "one week. The meetings give each person the opportunity to explore\n",
      "the roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner\n",
      "life and human solidarity. The meetings in summer can have up to\n",
      "6,000 participants a week. Three times every day, the brothers and\n",
      "everybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Church\n",
      "of Reconciliation, built in 1962 when the village church became too\n",
      "small.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH\" The community has never wanted to\n",
      "create a \"movement\" around itself. Instead, people are called to\n",
      "commit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood,\n",
      "their city or village. To support them in this, Taize has created\n",
      "what it calls \"a pilgrimage of trust on earth\". At the end of each\n",
      "year, the pilgrimage has a \"European meeting\" which brings together\n",
      "tens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe for\n",
      "several days in a major city. There have also been meetings in Asia\n",
      "and in the United States. Every year, Brother Roger writes an open\n",
      "letter to the young. Usually completed during a stay in one of the\n",
      "poor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languages\n",
      "and provide themes for reflexion for the following year.\n",

      "wax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\n",
      "of Central Asia.\n",
      "  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\n",
      "offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\n",
      "ritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\n",
      "custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\n",
      "relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\n",

      "known for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\n",
      "such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\n",
      "tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\n",

      "and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\n",
      "breath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\n",
      "that is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\n",
      "that of the priesthood: white.\n",
      "  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\n",
      "possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\n",
      "gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\n",
      "professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\n",
      "inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\n",
      "jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\n",
      "they were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\n",
      "for teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\n",
      "the \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\n",
      "the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\n",
      "master of himself.\n",
      "  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\n",
      "influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\n",
      "several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\n",
      "Gaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\n",
      "Smerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\n",
      "the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\n",
      "in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\n",
      "as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\n",
      "  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\n",
      "renowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\n",
      "the greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\n",
      "who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\n",
      "Bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\n",
      "also known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\n",
      "this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\n",
      "like \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\n",
      "Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\n",
      "had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\n",
      "  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\n",
      "is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\n",
      "western Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\n",
      "have been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\n",
      "Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\n",
      "contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\n",
      "varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\n",
      "  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\n",
      "varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\n",
      "historians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\n",
      "customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\n",
      "belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\n",
      "and eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\n",
      "even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\n",
      "Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\n",
      "Zoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\n",
      "placed themselves under his venerable name.\n",
      "  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\n",
      "eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\n",
      "elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\n",
      "often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\n",
      "Zoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\n",
      "daivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\n",
      "texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\n",
      "practices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\n",
      "chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\n",
      "supreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\n",
      "Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\n",
      "all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\n",
      "land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\n",
      "has been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\n",
      "absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\n",
      "priesthood, would be very strange.\n",
      "  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\n",
      "corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\n",
      "first millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\n",
      "directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\n",
      "us especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\n",
      "the ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\n",
      "of the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\n",
      "spirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\n",
      "Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\n",
      "formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\n",
      "astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\n",
      "Mesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\n",
      "to the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\n",
      "see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\n",
      "we give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\n",
      "  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\n",
      "important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in\n",
      "the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\n",
      "natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\n",
      "Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\n",
      "to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\n",
      "Hermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\n",
      "on the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\n",
      "survived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\n",
      "wisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\n",
      "of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\n",
      "abundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\n",
      "  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\n",
      "ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\n",

      "most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\n",
      "second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\n",
      "the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\n",
      "to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\n",

      "1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\n",
